Falafel salad,"This particular salad is great if you’re looking for something a little more substantial than a simple mix of greens and vegetables.",falafel_salad.png,"Mash chickpeas with the back of a fork until fairly uniform - you still want a few chunks of chickpea left in the falafel. Mix in garlic, onion, olive oil, flour, lemon juice, parsley, and dried spices. Form into small patties, about the size of an Oreo cookie. Heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Place falafel patties in the pan and cook for approximately three minutes on each side, or until nicely browned. Place falafel on a plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil. Place salad greens and tomatoes on a large serving platter. Place falafel on the salad and top with Feta cheese. Serve with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, tzatziki sauce, or creamy Feta dressing.",2,2
Gorgeous gado-gado salad,"An Indonesian mega salad. Tossed with the most incredible peanut dressing and served with crunchy prawn crackers, it’s a winning combo",gado_salad.png,"Start by prepping all your salad ingredients. Scrub the potatoes and cook in boiling salted water for around 15 minutes, or until tender, then halve or slice up. Soft-boil the eggs for 6 minutes, or longer if you prefer them more cooked. Cut the tofu into 2½cm chunks and fry in a splash of sesame oil for around 15 minutes, or until golden, then sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Finely shred the cabbage if you want it raw or, if you'd rather cook it (which is traditional), cut it into 2cm slices, place in a colander and slowly pour a kettle of boiling water over the top. For me, this is the perfect amount of heat to soften the cabbage, but means you keep much of the delicious nutrients in there – feel free to apply this to any other seasonal greens you can find, too. Cut the tomatoes into wedges, quarter the radishes and slice the cucumber (I use my crinkle-cut knife – you should get one!). Season everything from a height with a little salt. Next, put all the sauce ingredients into a blender, peeling the garlic and grating in the palm sugar (if needed), then blitz until smooth. Have a taste and adjust the seasoning, making sure the acidity of the lime sings through, so tweak with more, if needed.",3,3
Miso avocado salad,"Salad made with miso, avocado, & lima beans. Seasonal greens are tossed with an assertive, creamy miso dressing. There are beans, crunchy seeds, broccoli, and avocado - it all comes together into a brilliant, beautiful, feel-good salad.",miso_salad.png,"First make the dressing. Mix all your dressing ingredients together in a bowl, adding a little salt if needed, depending on how salty your miso is. Alternately, if the dressing is too salty, add more yogurt. Next, blanch the broccoli in boiling, salted water for a minute or so, until it has lost its rawness and is a lovely bright green. Drain and let cool. Toast the pumpkin and sesame seeds in a pan until lightly golden, then spread on a plate to cool. Pile the leaves into a serving bowl, then chop the avocado into chunks, and add them to the bowl along with the beans. Once the broccoli and seeds are cool, add them too. Pour over the dressing and toss well. Serve with steamed brown rice or soba noodles for a more substantial dinner.",4,4
Chicken salad,"The fresh, nutty, slightly spicy homemade dressing transforms this simple chicken salad",chicken_salad.png,"To poach the chicken, place in a large saucepan, cover with water, add the peppercorns and bay leaves and bring to a gentle simmer. Poach for about 40 minutes. If you can, leave it to cool in the liquid. Take the chicken out of the pan, remove the skin and shred the meat. Dry-fry the cumin and the almonds in a hot pan and leave to cool. To make the dressing, mix the yoghurt, mayonnaise and lemon zest and juice in a large bowl. Add the chicken, cucumber, cumin and almonds with the torn basil. Mix well and serve.",1,1
Caprese salad with grilled peppers,"This is my twist on the Italian classic salad and is perfect for whipping up on a hot summer's day",caprese_salad.png,"Place the peppers directly onto a naked gas flame or under a very hot grill and let them blacken and blister. Turn now and then with a pair of metal kitchen tongs. When blackened all over, pop them into a bowl and cover with cling film. Leave the peppers to steam for about 10 minutes, then remove the cling film and leave them to cool. When they are cool enough to handle, rub off the blackened skin and brush away the seeds from the inside. Tear the mozzarella balls into chunks and divide between four plates. Then tear the peppers into strips and divide over the plates of mozzarella. Scatter the tomato halves over the top. Season well with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Tear the basil leaves up and sprinkle them over the salad before serving. Tip: Always use fresh basil and the best mozzarella you can find.",2,2
